<!--
Thank you for contributing to helm/charts! ðŸ‘‹ðŸŽŠ

Please make sure:

1. This PR patches an existing chart

  ðŸ›‘ New charts are no longer accepted to stable or incubator. See
  "Status of the Project" and "Deprecation Timeline":
  * https://github.com/helm/charts/blob/master/README.md#status-of-the-project
  * https://github.com/helm/charts/blob/master/README.md#deprecation-timeline

2. You have read our technical requirements and best practices:

  * https://github.com/helm/charts/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#technical-requirements
  * https://github.com/helm/helm/tree/master/docs/chart_best_practices

  For a quick overview across what we will look at reviewing your PR, please
  read our review guidelines:
  * https://github.com/helm/charts/blob/master/REVIEW_GUIDELINES.md

  Following our best practices right from the start will accelerate the review
  process and help get your PR merged quicker.

3. You signed all your commits

  Otherwise we won't be able to merge the PR. See:
  * https://github.com/helm/charts/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#sign-your-work

4. You have tested your changes before you push them

  Once pushed, a CircleCI job will run across your changes and do some initial
  checks and linting. These checks run very quickly. Please check the results.
  These checks should pass before we continue reviewing your changes.

5. You do not squash history or rebase once PR review begins

  When updates to your PR are requested, please add new commits and do not
  squash the history. This makes easier for reviewers to identify new changes
  (note that PRs are always squashed when merged anyway).

  Additionally, when your PR needs to be updated with more recent changes to
  master (in order to pass tests, etc), be sure to merge master rather than
  rebasing and force-pushing, so inline review comments are not lost. See:
  * https://github.com/isaacs/github/issues/997

6. You mention in the PR description which issue it addresses

  This gives the PR more context, and helps ensure you have looked over
  existing issues before creating a PR. Since these are community charts,
  contributions should not only solve your use case, but ensure that root
  causes are found and addressed for related issues, while keeping the charts
  as stable as possible for the community.

  Optionally, using "fixes #123" syntax will close that issue when the
  PR is merged. See:
  * https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/closing-issues-using-keywords

7. You are patient and courteous

  Be aware the repo and chart OWNERS are volunteers so reviews are as time
  allows, and acceptance is up to the chart OWNERS. For faster feedback please
  @-mention maintainers that are listed in the Chart.yaml file.

  You may also reach out, but please be patient and courteous. See:
  https://github.com/helm/charts/blob/master/README.md#where-to-find-us
